## Software Engineer

I help companies grow their business and manage risk through quality software. My skills cut cross engineering, software development, quality assurance, and implementation. This gives me a broad experience base from which to draw in any situation. Combined with my technical skills, I bring value as a relentless problem solver who enjoys a challenge. I have a history of helping others and proactively recommending process improvements. 

During my engineering studies I took a programming course which made me curious about a career in software solutions. I knew that I always liked solving problems and discovered that I have an aptitude for coding. From there I completed a full stack coding bootcamp with Tech Elevator where I learned to develop web applications. What I like most about my career is that I can be hands-on. I enjoy challenges and find solving problems gratifying.
