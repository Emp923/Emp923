## Software Engineer

I am a Software Engineer in Pittsburgh with skills and experience in software development, automated testing, and solutions implementation. Combined with my technical skills, I bring value as a problem solver who enjoys a challenge. I enjoy working in teams and have a history of helping others. During my engineering studies I took a programming course and discovered that I have an aptitude for coding. From there I completed a full stack coding bootcamp with Tech Elevator. You can connect with me on LinkedIn.
